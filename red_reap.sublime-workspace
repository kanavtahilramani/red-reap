I should edit my post to mean I'm talking about by today's standards or the standards of the time.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nAlso. I'm not sure how using someone's rank makes me lack intelligence. I'm using our only objective standard of evidence to compare my game knowledge versus his. Rank isn't there for no reason and suggests that I've spent more time learning about the game than he has and so my opinion holds more weight than his does.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nI totally disagree with that. I'm a higher rank than him because I've played way more than him and my understanding of the mechanics of the game and the strategy behind the game are more developed. To say that he knows more than me would be to also support an assumption that it's only through my mechanics that I am higher rank than he is. He's making the argument that the P250 is fine without an understanding of armor penetration or the way T-Side pistol is meant to be played.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nI totally disagree with that.

A women's right to choose ends when there IS another life. Whether there is one is the question. I think it's a morally and logically unsupportable position to maintain that a woman has the right to choose if her choice would take a life.\n\nThere is one more step though where even if people agreed when life began, and the fetus was past that point, but birthing the fetus would harm the mother, or a fetus conceived of rape existed then I think abortion is fine in all cases at that point. However, I think science needs to find the line, because it certainly is earlier than when it actually is birthed, and certainly is later than the current Supreme Court's line.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court Litigation\n\nHelp me.

Simply by the fact that the fire rate sucks on the M4A1 now means that necessarily its damage per second is lower. the damage at distance drop off is negligible IMO, I'm an eagle player so these are just my thoughts.\n\nI don't really care about the per bullet damage because I'm rarely just going to be one shot, most high ELO players (AKA DMG or above I'd say) don't one tap much, even at long range they'll be spraying. I simply think, and many pros have commented that the A1 is kind of shit now and I tend to agree.

I'm taking an pre-law undergrad con-law course focused on civil liberties, how do you feel about incorporation of the BoR using the 14th amendment?\n\nI think it's pretty cool how over time the court moved the line away from the states and towards federal control.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nIt was during an interview at some tourney.

I'm sure tying more conditions and addictions is agreeable to you? Ah, you gotta be pretty stupid if you're a meth addict, because you know, it's bad for you and stuff.\n\nStfu dude, there are tons of extremely intelligent people that happen to be obese, it turns out loving food, hating running, and having a slower BMR makes you fat, and it also turns out that being constantly vigilant at every meal is exhausting.\n\nAnd before you give me the \"I SAID THAT FAT\" response, it doesn't matter, you're hinting at some sort of positive correlation between the two and its fucking absurd.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nIf I might ask.

Even as a 2k player in 5k games when I was worse I never had that much trouble. Just stand in XP range, no reason you can't do that.

Did you enjoy your time there (as much as someone can enjoy 1L lol)?\n\nDo you know if people that aren't top 10 (say top quarter) still have decent job prospects, I know in Houston there's tons of non-biglaw opportunities so do you know if it's mostly biglaw or bust or not?\n\nAny other comments on UH law school?

I'm miles ahead of the medians for regionals like South Texas or St. Mary's, and I would get in to those with tons of money. What are my job prospects from those assuming I perform well, from your experience.\n\nAlternatively, if money isn't an issue (dad has me mostly covered for law school) would you look at this a bit differently?\n\nFinally as far as the LSAT medians, I'm like 1 or 2 points, literally 4 or 5 questions below, which makes me think the room for error is such that I can, for intellectual purposes (my ability to mentally compete) count my self at their median. Couple that with that fact that my undergrad (UT) is probably more difficult than many other applicants whose GPA is lower than mine median wise and didn't go to a school that was so difficult and demanding, it makes me feel like from an intellectual point of view I'm right in the middle of the pack. So say I do get in, is it so hard to believe that I could be competitive? Of course that assumes I can get in!!\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nWell then let me ask you this.

Is this site real?\n\nA. Mostly, yes. I try to make things entertaining, some are articles are categorized as comedy, but you should feel free to take almost all of it literally. I really do think it’s morally justifiable to kill police and other government agents, as they are the violent oppressors of free humanity. I really do think feminism is a hate movement and full of shit that this world would just be better off without. I really do think race baiting is a bigger problem than racism. I really do think the world would be better off if some people just killed themselves. I really do believe that government is a completely fictitious excuse to do harm, and nothing else, and that violent overthrow is the only solution.\n\nQ. Is this your real name?\n\nA. Yes, my real name is Christopher Cantwell. It says this name on my drivers license, and if I paid taxes I would pay taxes in this name. I ran for Congress under this name. If I were to apply for a full time job, the employer would find this website. That’s why this website is my primary source of income, and you should consider donating or advertising here if you support my work, like so many other generous people and savvy advertisers already have.\n\nQ. Where do you live? I want to make threats of violence against you!\n\nA. I’m not hard to find, pussy. Your threats don’t scare me, I’m a 225lbs trained fighter with a concealed carry license and firearms training. I’ve also been locked up with scarier guys than you.

I really do believe that government is a completely fictitious excuse to do harm, and nothing else, and that violent overthrow is the only solution.\n\nQ. Is this your real name?\n\nA. Yes, my real name is Christopher Cantwell. It says this name on my drivers license, and if I paid taxes I would pay taxes in this name. I ran for Congress under this name. If I were to apply for a full time job, the employer would find this website. That’s why this website is my primary source of income, and you should consider donating or advertising here if you support my work, like so many other generous people and savvy advertisers already have.\n\nQ. Where do you live? I want to make threats of violence against you!\n\nA. I’m not hard to find, pussy. Your threats don’t scare me, I’m a 225lbs trained fighter with a concealed carry license and firearms training. I’ve also been locked up with scarier guys than you. See me when you see me, and stop talking shit on the internet, you fucking bitch. If you were really ’bout it we wouldn’t be having this conversation, would we?\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nI'm sure no one will see this, but this recorder is a fucking asshole.

Burglary is a crime of stealth so making it easier to be stealthy is ill-advised.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\n&gt; We're getting tired of Israel using our tax dollars to harm Palestinians.\n\nLol. I'm sure the Israeli people are tired of having missiles launched into their homes.\n\n&gt;You need to figure out how to get along or at least get a two-state solution (and then respect Palestine's sovereignty)\n\nLike Israel tried to do in 2005, or maybe every time they accepted a peace treaty in the most recent bout of rocket attacks only to have it broken by Palestinians.\n\n&gt;  The United States can't afford to support you anymore.\n\nTell that to our defense spending...\n\n&gt;Our infrastructure is crumbling\n\nCan you give me an example?\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nCan you still improve and become good in CSGO MM?

He WAS actively involving himself in the situation. So to prove I'm wrong here you have to show me that he was being completely silent for most of the video and not being obvious, if you can't do that you are WRONG on this count.\n\nYour second flaw in reasoning rests on this \"irrationality\" and \"don't know what's best for them. On the irrational argument, do you think the average person wouldn't be upset by some random person filming an argument between them and their girlfriend? Regardless of how she reacted, that would piss ANYONE off, so to support your irrationality argument, you must believe that people wouldn't normally be upset by this, which you probably can't. And on the \"know what's best for them\" it's not his JOB to know what's best for them any more than it's my job to know what's best for you, you know this as a fact, and so know that that is also an UNSUPPORTABLE argument\n\nYour final argument about public versus private. Where they had their argument doesn't affect this guy's ability to leave it alone, he chose to involve himself (see Paragraph 1).\n\nMost of your points are unsupportable, or not reflective of generally accepted reality, but I'd like to see how you attempt to defend them...\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nI have a lot of asian ingredients....I was thinking a marinade incorporating some kind of chipotle sauce, or maybe some kind of lemon juice/soy sauce based marinade.

On this we agree. When I see a 300 LB man with 2 ft. long hot dogs and a bucket of fries at the baseball game I am as judgmental as the next guy. But when I see a fat person that consistently is trying to run and lose weight and eat better. Or even do all that and failing, I can see understand how frustrating it is, because really, its FRUSTRATING. And it makes it all the more frustrating to read the comments of people on Reddit that have never been in that position...\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nWell I'm glad we agree there. I think being changing from being fat is something that we need to make clear. IT's not really about \"I'm going to diet and lose weight.\" It's more like conforming to the regular bodily functions like eating lean proteins and normal portions. There's millions of years of evolution that promotes the consumption of starches and high energy foods that obese people fight, and producing a lifestyle that is counter to that takes time. For those that don't try I can't account for them with any legitimate argument.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nWell I'm glad we agree there.

People talk about Israeli war crimes, and killing Israeli children. Right? Dude, if Hamas had the means to accomplish their goal of wiping out Israel they would kill a limitless number of children.\n\nThat's why literally any anti-Israel argument SUCKS. Israel will never be as evil as Hamas and never commit the crimes that group would given the means. The argument is automatically won for a Zionist like I am.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nI'm also barbaric, I play mostly Slark in DoTA 2.

Israel tends to be more to the left (I am included in that, except on Israel/Palestine) the left wing in America generally is anti-Israel it could be because Israel is perceived as war hawks, and the left tends to be anti-war.\n\nThat's fine, I just think they are both making mistakes so condemning Israel without letting the other shoe drop that Hamas is equally bad is unfair.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nFuck dude.

You have to accept that context matters and just saying \"KIDS DYING\" is not a valid argument.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nNo. I'm just showing that if faced with that decision you would choose one or the other, WEIGHING the circumstances.

I'm just saying, if Israel was REALLY trying to kill Gazans, don't you think the number would be higher than 425?\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nLet me edit the analogy. Firstly, I am picking sides, I side with Israel. Secondly, imagine every time your friend stops kicking the drunk guy the drunk guy gets up starts screaming \"EVERYONE, EVERYONE, THIS GUY WONT STOP PUNCHING ME\" while throwing his own drunk punches which your friend is really great at dodging, but I mean he still doesn't want to get hit.\n\nIsrael just wants Hamas to stop.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nMistakes were made, but I the only true evidence is that the children died not that the Israelis were on the boat like \"THOSE LOOK LIKE KIDS RIPE FOR THE KILLING\". I don't even mean all btw, I'm just saying an army the size of Israel would have a death toll way more insane than 425 in an area of 1.5 million if they were really trying to do civilian damage.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nAh. I'm glad we can have some argument theory in here.\n\nThe person that makes that positive statement has what's called the burden of proof.

I'm so tired of people like you. Do you think Israel is just waiting in the wings for the first chance to fuck with Hamas because they think it's fun? Israel WAS THE ONE THAT ACCEPTED THE CEASFIRE.

And your idea that we \"work our way into a platonic friend position\" is patently incorrect.\n\nThe truth is people don't want to be seen as shallow. When someone says \"we're just friends\" what they really mean is \"you're not physically attractive enough for me to be interested in sleeping with you, however hanging out with you under no sexual context is ok\". It's the way for people to justify how shallow they are without feeling like shit.\n\nThe friend zone doesn't exist for attractive people. I know because I was once fat and got friend zoned continuously it was literally like I could draw a 1:1 graph the amount of time I've been friend zoned correlated with my weight is clear and unalarming. As Iost weight I proportionally was friend zoned less, all else equal. People are shallow.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nIt really doesn't matter. I don't represent the common idea of Israelis. But if it were up to me Id make the attacks so severe and intense that Palestinians would have to stop.

Extremist Palestinian groups.\n\n\n\n\nfound VP with matching id\n\n\n\n\nI think analogy is fine because if you had any empathy for Israel it may give you a thorough understanding of the situation. As of now you have no perspective from which to understand the position Israel is in. It's not like I'm too dumb to comprehend it, or think you are.\n\n&gt;If you can explain why Israel ought to occupy the west bank (and maybe Gaza again? I dunno, you tell me) indefinitely and force the palestinians there to live under their rule at gunpoint, I'd be happy to have a discussion.\n\nI diiscussed this. It is unfair to expect Israel to give up land they fought to take unless they can be CERTAIN it won't be used to attack them. The converse, however, is almost certain, if Israel DOES give up control of Gaza and The West Bank they are almost assured to be attacked in more central and populous locations. It's not like Israelis take pleasure in cracking down on people in this area, however certain groups have made it undeniably clear that they present a dangerous and ever-existent threat.\n\n\n",

I'm miles ahead of the medians for regionals like South Texas or St. Mary's, and I would get in to those with tons of money. What are my job prospects from those assuming I perform well, from your experience.\n\nAlternatively, if money isn't an issue (dad has me mostly covered for law school) would you look at this a bit differently?\n\nFinally as far as the LSAT medians, I'm like 1 or 2 points, literally 4 or 5 questions below, which makes me think the room for error is such that I can, for intellectual purposes (my ability to mentally compete) count my self at their median. Couple that with that fact that my undergrad (UT) is probably more difficult than many other applicants whose GPA is lower than mine median wise and didn't go to a school that was so difficult and demanding, it makes me feel like from an intellectual point of view I'm right in the middle of the pack. So say I do get in, is it so hard to believe that I could be competitive? Of course that assumes I can get in!!\n\n\n\n\nRight so by responding he is involving himself.

Is this site real?\n\nA. Mostly, yes. I try to make things entertaining, some are articles are categorized as comedy, but you should feel free to take almost all of it literally. I really do think it’s morally justifiable to kill police and other government agents, as they are the violent oppressors of free humanity. I really do think feminism is a hate movement and full of shit that this world would just be better off without. I really do think race baiting is a bigger problem than racism. I really do think the world would be better off if some people just killed themselves. I really do believe that government is a completely fictitious excuse to do harm, and nothing else, and that violent overthrow is the only solution.\n\nQ. Is this your real name?\n\nA. Yes, my real name is Christopher Cantwell. It says this name on my drivers license, and if I paid taxes I would pay taxes in this name. I ran for Congress under this name. If I were to apply for a full time job, the employer would find this website. That’s why this website is my primary source of income, and you should consider donating or advertising here if you support my work, like so many other generous people and savvy advertisers already have.\n\nQ. Where do you live? I want to make threats of violence against you!\n\nA. I’m not hard to find, pussy. Your threats don’t scare me, I’m a 225lbs trained fighter with a concealed carry license and firearms training. I’ve also been locked up with scarier guys than you. See me when you see me, and stop talking shit on the internet, you fucking bitch. If you were really ’bout it we wouldn’t be having this conversation, would we?\n\n\n\n\nI'm sure no one will see this, but this recorder is a fucking asshole. Of course it's LEGAL to record people, but not only are you being provocative, and I don't know why no one has said this, he's being FUCKING NOSY. Like it's none of his business what's going on between a couple, like it really isn't. Sure, if the guy is beating the shit out of his girlfriend, that's one thing, but couples fight all the time.\n\nThen it only exacerbates the fact that he's already being an inflammatory idiot by having a gun on him like \"I'm a fucking retard vigilante, so when I provoke you, I can kill you for being upset by it\".\n\nFuck people like this guy.\n\n\n\n\nI was talking to my friend, I'm a huge Spurs fan and my friend is a Rockets fan, after our loss to yall he was so pumped because he said he'd rather play the Spurs than LA. Last night he was like \"FREE GAME 1!! NO CP3 AND THEYRE AWAY!!\" and I said, just watch, the Clippers ain't nothing to fuck with. And then they got slaughtered. Idk man.\n\n\n\n\nCan you still improve and become good in CSGO MM? I'm only SEM so I'm not sure...joining one of the other leagues is useful for me?\n\n\n\n\nShit. Idk man. I think that honestly it serves them well in some areas and not in others. I was a nerd that hung out with popular kids (I had some social skills but was still quirky)  and a lot of them honestly while they did join good frats and many have cute girlfriends, they go to shitty schools and are getting shitty degrees. Where the nerds are going to top schools (Harvard, Stanford, etc) and building a strong future....\n\n\n\n\nOh god. Ya I was just kidding. But you get the point. Your boy just wants to do his Romanian deadlifts in peace.\n\n\n\n\nI'm a fatass. I started at 244 pounds and am down 10 pounds now. Let me tell you something. I was TERRIFIED of the gym. Like absolutely completely horrified. Then I went the first time I realized that literally NOBODY CARES. Like people are so focused on their workout that you could be in the rack doing the wrongest shittiest workout ever and people wouldn't care. Not that you should, it's just to illustrate the point that people aren't happy, or sad, or annoyed that you're there. They literally don't even REALIZE you're there.\n\n\n\n\nI was reading what you wrote above and was actually completely blown away with what you wrote. Holy shit. Teach me to write friend. I'm pre-law and feel like if I could write with such coherency and flow then holy shit would I be a good attorney.\n\nYou're the fucking coolest.\n\n\n\n\nAh. The lowest rungs of hell are reserved for \"hits on girls at the gym guy\". I thought people knew by now that this is widely considered gym taboo? I'm a dude and I keep to my fucking sets I try I avoid talking to anyone but my partner.\n\nI also dislike \"gives advice guy\" cuz fuck off, I'll ask for your advice if I need it. We all have access to r/fitness\n\n\n\n\nOur 1000 year old book? Lol I'm an atheist good job having a grasp on geopolitics though. You sound so fucking stupid. This is politics \"Arab land\" doesn't make sense because \"Arab\" isn't a fucking country you dipshit.\n\n\n\n\nI was a ninja runner in kindergarten when I would watch DBZ....I grew out of that shit when I realized it didn't make my fat ass any faster.\n\nEDIT: Maybe not, I ran not with my hands behind my back but I would like keep my hands in karate chop form as I ran\n\n\n\n\nAre you going to produce your evidence, or call me delusional? I'm a government major, we deal in evidence. The burden of proof is on you, present evidence for your argument, or edit/delete it to admit that you were wrong. But don't leave inaccuracies floating around the net if you aren't capable/willing to defend them\n\n\n\n\nAh thanks! Sorry I'm just a silly American lol.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you sound like a cool dad. Second how is Ruth's Chris? I want to try it. Third, I'm a switcher. I hold my fork left handed and cut left handed so when I eat steak I have to stab it with my left the. Hold the fork with my right and cut with my left then put the knife down and grab the form with my left. I look like a big fucking idiot the entire time....\n\n\n\n\nI'm 20 haha. Regardless my point is I simply disagree. The only time in my life I've ever been successful with women is since I've slimmed down, so from an individual standpoint I believe people only care about physical attractiveness. I compound that with how rarely I see people dating that are not nearly the same in attractiveness I am comfortable concluding that everyone dates for purely physical reasons at least for the first good while\n\nFrom this basis I can derive that the friendzone only exists in that people like someone's personality but are my physically attracted to them enough to sleep with them. By extension I think any male and female friendship can change to a romantic one if one person becomes as attractive as the other through the course of it.\n\n\n\n\nLol I'm just an American Jew, and a Zionist. But I guess it's cute that you want to have conspiracies.\n\n\n\n\nLol I'm just an American Jew, and a Zionist. But I guess it's cute that you want to have conspiracies.\n\n\n\n\nLol. You realize that every statement you're making I can argue back to you. You're insulting people with no backing and it's super immature.\n\nI'm a government major at one of the most prestigious Universities in the world. It's my JOB to have strong opinions on conflicts.\n\nI'm not pompous at all about it until you make arrogant statements. And you, as TOTAL layman shouldn't be either. It's not like I sit in my upper-division comparative politics classes and think what people like you are feeling about the subject.\n\nRather than being a big asshole to people and psycho-analyzing them maybe you should actually read up on the topics and not be a big piece of shit to people that are just discussing things.\n\n\n\n\nSee this isn't how arguments work. You don't keep hammering into a point that I'm answering until I give you the answer you want. I don't AGREE with you and I'm giving you solid evidence to back my argument up.\n\nPalestinians have always attacked Israel, when Israel tries to ease up the Palestinian attacks intensify. Therefore, Palestinians are uninterested in peace and their land will be occupied until they are willing to be peaceful. It's completely justified.\n\nThe argument is over, and I think I won if you're unable to conjure anything better than \"I'M RIGHT AND YOU'RE NOT THINKING CLEARLY\"\n\n\n\n\nSee this isn't how arguments work.
